# **Smart Traffic Management System using Reinforcement Learning**

This project demonstrates a **Smart Traffic Management System** powered by **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. The system simulates traffic patterns in a custom environment and trains an RL agent to optimize traffic light timings, reducing congestion and improving traffic flow.

---

## **Project Overview**
- **Goal**: Minimize traffic congestion by dynamically controlling traffic lights using an RL-based approach.
- **Environment**: A custom traffic environment simulates road intersections with varying levels of congestion.
- **Model**: The RL agent is based on **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, implemented using **Stable-Baselines3**.
- **Visualization**: Real-time traffic data is visualized to evaluate the agent's performance.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Custom Gym Environment**: Simulates traffic flow, representing congestion at four intersections.
- **Dynamic Traffic Patterns**: Includes simulated rush hours with varying vehicle inflows.
- **RL Optimization**: PPO agent learns to manage traffic lights for optimal flow.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks cumulative rewards and congestion levels over time.
- **Visualization**: Plots traffic trends to illustrate system improvements.

---

## **Project Highlights**
- **Reinforcement Learning**: PPO effectively learns policies to reduce congestion during high traffic hours.
- **Scalability**: The environment can be extended to simulate larger road networks.
- **Real-Time Application**: Can serve as a foundation for deploying AI-driven traffic systems in smart cities.

## **Visualization**
The system generates plots for:
- **Cumulative Rewards**: Showing how the agent improves over time.
- **Traffic Flow Trends**: Demonstrating the reduction of congestion across intersections.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Integrate real-world traffic data for more realistic simulations.
- Expand the model to handle multi-lane and multi-direction intersections.
- Add support for SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) for detailed simulations.
